need to mass sensitive fields if logging parameters

I kept the generated DB fields from Entity Framework as is; ideally, for string fields should be nvarhcar with a length instead of nvarchar(max)

I modified database field names for better naming convention

create a function to validate token instead of just checking for null/empty

due to identity column configured with EF, had to resort to set the id property in PatientLabVisit to null

already set all tables with foreign keys on delete cascade on if a record from the master table (PatientDetails) is deleted

unable to test other external endpoints, had to resort to using the same endpoint GetLabVisit 3X for the concurrent api calls requirement

added 1 function annotation need to do the rest

need to add comments to long logic

need to refine caching settings to be more dynamic

need to add retry mechanism. Will increase round trip time. Depending on the criticality of the request. If the request is asynchronous then add the request to a queue instead.

need to add authentication to web api

need to add unit testing
